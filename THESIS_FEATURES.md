## Key Academic Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Context-Aware Recommendation System
- **Match Percentage Algorithm**: Calculates compatibility based on exact relational matches between offered and wanted skills.
- **Smart Suggestions**: Queries the database to exclude users already in an active rotation.

### 2. Peer-to-Peer Communication Module
- **Notification System**: Checks database status to trigger unread request alerts.
- **Activity Timeline**: Complete history of user interactions.

### 3. Trust & Verification Framework
- **Bilateral Review Logic**: Swaps are only marked "COMPLETED" when both parties submit a review.
- **Reputation Algorithm**: Weighted average scoring calculated dynamically from the database.

### 4. Full-Stack Data Aggregation
- **Live Leaderboards**: Utilizes Prisma `_count` aggregations to rank users securely on the backend without overloading the frontend.

## Technical Implementation Highlights

### Backend Architecture (The Engine)
- **Node.js & Express**: Robust RESTful API architecture
- **Prisma ORM**: Type-safe database schema management and querying
- **MySQL Database**: Relational data storage for users, swaps, skills, and forums
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based route protection (`authenticateToken` middleware)

### Frontend Architecture (The Client)
- **React** with TypeScript
- **React Router** for protected and admin-level routing
- **Component-based** architecture using Tailwind CSS and Lucide Icons
- **Dynamic State Management**: Fetch API calls synced with React `useEffect` and `useState`

### Key User Flows
1. **The Core Loop**: Sign Up → Add Skills → View Skill Radar → Send Request → Partner Accepts in Notifications → Finalize Swap Agreement → Log Sessions → Submit Review → Earn Rating.
2. **Community Interaction**: Open Forum → Select Category → Start Thread → Receive Comments from Peers.

## Future Enhancement Possibilities
1. **Real-time WebSockets**: Upgrade standard API polling to WebSocket integration for live chat.
2. **Payment Integration**: Premium features or system credits.
3. **Mobile Apps**: Native iOS/Android applications.
4. **AI Matching**: Machine learning algorithms for advanced skill compatibility.

## Code Statistics
- **24+ Pages**: Complete, production-ready interfaces
- **Secure Backend API**: Dozens of protected endpoints handling business logic
- **100% TypeScript**: Type-safe development across the entire stack
